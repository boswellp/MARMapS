MARMaps is a free, open-source tool for making interactive and transparent suitability maps. It is currently in development. For questions, bugs, feedback or comments please contact ggorski@ucsc.edu. See the userguide for more information, and see the tutorial for an example case. The application can be found https://ggorski.shinyapps.io/marmaps/  If you would like to use the code, please contact me and I can provide you with an updated version as improvements are ongoing.

This tool was developed in collaboration with Daniel Goode, Michael van der Valk, and Andrew Fisher. Some data for the tutorial were generated by Sarah Beganskas.
